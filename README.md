# Overview

IaC bring ease to definition, deployment, incremental upgrades and removing of infrastrucure. VM to infrastracture should be deployed using terrafrom, whilst VM image should be created using packer to be able to easily deploy new instances of same infrastructure. This project will be able to deploy scaleable web application in Azure space using  Azure pipelines and or github actions.

1. In Azure, start Azure Cloud shell and get local SSH
2. Add SSH for Azure CS to your github account
2. Fork or copy files from this project to your repository
3. On such scaffolding code, run local tests
4. Clone project to Azure cloud shell
5. Setup Github Actions
7. Prepare Azure DevOps project
8. Connect Github repository and Azure pipeline (yml from this project will allow you that)
9. Make tests and have logs:
